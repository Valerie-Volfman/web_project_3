                                river.
                                Of course, no one in their right mind would swim in the river, unless they grew up here,

                                which case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot here, and the

                                are drafty, but the fall and the spring are are absolutely amazing.</p>
                            <p class="card__text">The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet architecture, all of it
                                sprinkled with modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the

                                is difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing heels. The left bank is

                                Minsk has a large railway network which connects Brest, Moscow, Vilnius and Gomel. There

                                You can easily reach any place by bus, trolleybus or tram. Minsk, like most big European
